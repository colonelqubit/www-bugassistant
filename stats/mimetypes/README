This file contains information about our MIMEtypes work

Usage
-------

Run this script on the command line. It'll spit out some information
about the attachments we find suspect.

If MAX_NUM_BUGS is set to something large (e.g. 500), and both
DOWNLOAD_ATTACHMENTS and CREATE_HTML_REPORT are both set to 1, the
script will download attachments from a large number of included bugs
and provide a fancy HTML page (see file index.html) showing which
attachment MIMEtypes we find suspect.


Install
-------

You might need to install the following package support:
- feedparser   # Ubuntu: python-feedparser

Why?
----

The reason why we currently care so much about MIMEtypes in Bugzilla
is because our current instance on FDO incorrectly sets the MIMEtype
on many of our attachments.


What do we regard as suspect?
-----------------------------

Supported:
- Any attachment of type application/octet-stream

Planned:
- Attachments where "file -b --mime-type <attachment>" does
  not match the mimetype in bugzilla
- Any file extension we haven't run into yet (we can whitelist)
- Any file w/o a file extension (probably)
